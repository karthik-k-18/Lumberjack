## Problem Statement

Lumberjack is a bot that makes best decisions for lumberjack's route to make highest profits in given time span for different specifications of trees on grid.

## Input Format

The first line of input contains two integers, N and M, where N is the number of rows and M is the number of columns in the grid. The next N lines contain M space-separated integers, where the jth integer in the ith line denotes the number of trees in the ith row and jth column of the grid.

## Output Format


The first line of output should contain the maximum profit that can be earned by the lumberjack.

## Constraints

1 <= N, M <= 1000

## Sample Input

```

3 3

1 2 3

4 5 6

7 8 9

```

## Sample Output

```

29

```

## Explanation

The maximum profit that can be earned by the lumberjack is 29. The path followed by the lumberjack is shown below.

```

1 2 3

4 5 6


7 8 9

```


## Solution

The solution is implemented in C++ using STL and algorithms. The code is well commented and easy to understand. The code is divided into 3 parts:

1. **Input:** The input is taken from the user and stored in a 2D vector.

2. **Processing:** The processing is done using the STL and algorithms. The code is divided into 3 parts:

    1. **Path:** The path is calculated using the STL and algorithms. The path is stored in a 2D vector.

    2. **Profit:** The profit is calculated using the STL and algorithms. The profit is stored in a 2D vector.

    3. **Output:** The output is printed using the STL and algorithms.

3. **Output:** The output is printed using the STL and algorithms.

## How to run the code

1. Download the code from the repository.

2. Open the terminal and go to the directory where the code is stored.

3. Run the following command:

    ```
    g++ Lumberjack.cpp -o Lumberjack
    ```


4. Run the following command:

    ```


    ./Lumberjack

    ```


5. Enter the input as per the format given in the problem statement.

6. The output will be displayed on the terminal.
